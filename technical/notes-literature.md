# Literature Notes for Cliche Constants

This file lists some of the standard ingredients behind the Cliche Constants.

## Planck Units

- Planck length and time are defined from c, ħ, and G and give  
  ℓ_P ~ 10^{-35} m and t_P ~ 10^{-44} s.  
- They delimit the scale where quantum gravity effects are expected to become unavoidable.

## Hubble Radius and Cosmology

- The Hubble parameter H_0 sets a characteristic scale  
  R_H = c / H_0 ~ 10^{26} m for our universe.  
- This is a standard order-of-magnitude for the size of the observable universe's causal domain.

## De Sitter Entropy

- The de Sitter horizon area leads to an entropy  
  S_dS ~ 10^{122} for a Lambda-dominated universe like ours.  
- This entropy is central in discussions of:
  - holography in de Sitter space,  
  - cosmological horizons,  
  - and the enormous "information capacity" of the universe at late times.

## Recurrence and IR Limits

- Finite-entropy quantum systems are expected (under certain assumptions) to exhibit Poincare-type recurrences on timescales of order e^S.  
- Applying this idea to de Sitter space motivates the Cliche Time  
  τ^R = e^{S_dS} t_P as a symbolic IR bound.

## How these pieces combine

The **Cliche Constants** take:

- UV scales: (ℓ_P, t_P),  
- IR scales: (R_H, S_dS),

and package them into two named quantities:

- **Cliche Length** ℓ^R = c / H_0,  
- **Cliche Time**  τ^R = e^{S_dS} t_P.

Nothing here is new physics by itself; the novelty is in giving these IR limits a concise, reusable naming scheme for pedagogy, speculation, and modeling.
