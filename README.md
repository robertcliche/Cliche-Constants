## 📖 Overview

The **Cliche Constants** are conceptual upper-bound analogs to the Planck units, representing the **infrared (cosmological) limits** of space and time where classical or quantum physics may **cease to be meaningful**.

Proposed by **Robert Cliche**, these constants define the **maximum observable scale** (`ℓᴿ`) and the **maximum meaningful duration** (`τᴿ`) beyond which spacetime may no longer support coherent physical law — just as the Planck constants define the minimum scales below which quantum gravity dominates.

## 📏 Cliche Length (ℓᴿ)

### 🔹 Definition
The **Cliche Length** is defined as the **maximum causally coherent spatial extent** of the universe.

\[
\ell^R = R_H = \frac{c}{H_0}
\]

Where:
- \( R_H \approx 1.3 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m} \) is the Hubble radius
- \( c \) is the speed of light
- \( H_0 \) is the Hubble constant

### 🔹 Interpretation
- Analogous to the Planck length in the **IR limit**
- Represents a **soft upper bound** on the meaningful size of coherent geometry
- Marks the spatial scale beyond which events cannot influence an observer

---

## ⏳ Cliche Time (τᴿ)

### 🔹 Definition
The **Cliche Time** is defined as the **maximum meaningful timescale** for physical evolution, based on quantum recurrence.

\[
\tau^R = e^{S_{dS}} \cdot t_P
\]

Where:
- \( S_{dS} = \frac{3\pi}{\Lambda G} \sim 10^{122} \) is the de Sitter entropy
- \( t_P \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{s} \) is the Planck time
- \( \Lambda \) is the cosmological constant
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant

### 🔹 Interpretation
- Time limit after which **unitarity, causality, and information coherence** may break down
- Useful in frameworks exploring **recurrence**, **cosmological decoherence**, or the **limits of predictability**
