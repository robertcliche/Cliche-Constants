# Taglines, Phrases, and Social Snippets

A grab-bag of short, reusable lines for talks, slides, and social posts.

## Short taglines

- "Planck tells us how small; Cliche tells us how big."  
- "From quantum foam to cosmic cliche."  
- "Cliche Length: the size of 'here' when 'here' means everything you can ever talk to."  
- "Cliche Time: the moment when even the universe runs out of new material."  
- "If Planck is the pixel, Cliche is the screen."  

---

## Slide-friendly hooks

- "We already have a name for the smallest meaningful length. Why not for the largest?"  
- "Somewhere between ℓ_P and ℓ^R, every story you care about is told."  
- "Beyond Cliche Time, asking 'what happens next?' might be the wrong question."

## Social-length blurbs

- **Blurbs for physicists**

  - "Introducing Cliche Constants: IR analogs of Planck units built from c/H_0 and e^{S_dS} t_P. Names for the 'too big' and 'too long' regime of spacetime."  
  - "We talk about Planck scales for UV. Cliche Length ℓ^R = c/H_0 and Cliche Time τ^R = e^{S_dS} t_P propose a matching IR vocabulary."  

- **Blurbs for general audiences**

  - "Physicists have a name for the smallest meaningful size in the universe. Cliche Constants ask: what about the biggest size and the longest time that still make sense?"  
  - "Imagine a time so long that the universe has tried every story it can tell. That is what Cliche Time is meant to capture—more a thought-experiment than a countdown."

## Visual metaphors

- **"Zoom slider" graphic**  
  - Left end: Planck length ("too small for space as we know it")  
  - Right end: Cliche Length ("too big for shared causality")  

- **"Timeline" graphic**  
  - Near zero: Planck time ("too quick for ordinary events")  
  - Far right: Cliche Time ("too late for a unique history")  

These can be turned into simple SVGs or slides for talks and posts.
