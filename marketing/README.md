# Cliche-Constants: positioning and use-cases

Cliche-Constants gives names and simple code for extreme **length**, **time**, and **temperature** scales suggested by standard cosmology and semiclassical gravity.

It is deliberately modest in scope:

- No new physics is claimed.
- The focus is on **communication and pedagogy**.
- The tone is light, but the definitions track real cosmological quantities.

Core ideas:

- Planck scales (\(\ell_P, t_P, T_P\)) as *ultraviolet* limits.
- Cliche Length and Time (\(\ell^R, \tau^R\)) as *infrared* limits.
- Cliche-Hot and Cliche-Very-Hot as **local** and **cosmic** “absolute hot” scales:
  - **cliche-hot**: a Planck-scale predictive ceiling for temperature.
  - **cliche-very-hot**: a Hubble-scale predictive ceiling where the whole observable universe would collapse.

## 1. Audiences

### 1.1 Physics students and researchers

- A convenient shorthand in talks and notes:
  - “Below the Planck scale” vs “Beyond the Cliche scale”.
  - “Below Cliche-Hot” vs “Above any meaningful local predictive temperature”.
- A way to frame UV vs IR limits in one slide without long verbal explanations.
- A small, self-contained code snippet that can be dropped into toy models and back-of-the-envelope estimates.

Suggested tagline:

> *From Planck to Cliche: bracketing the useful universe in space, time, and temperature.*

### 1.2 Science communicators and educators

- A hook for public talks, videos, or popular-science articles:
  - “Planck length and Planck temperature mark the smallest and hottest meaningful scales.”
  - “Cliche length, time, and Cliche-Hot temperatures mark when things become too big, too late, or too hot to matter for detailed predictions.”
- Visuals contrasting:
  - Microscopic ladder (down to \(\ell_P\) and up to Cliche-Hot).
  - Cosmic ladder (up to \(\ell^R\) and Cliche-Very-Hot).

Can be used to motivate:

- Why physicists care about extreme scales.
- Why some questions (“what happens after \(10^{10^{122}}\) seconds at Cliche-Very-Hot temperatures?”) are effectively outside the domain of testable science.

### 1.3 Curious general audiences

- A playful but honest answer to:
  - “How small can things meaningfully get?”
  - “How big or how long is *too* big / too long to matter?”
  - “Is there such a thing as an absolute hot?”

Short elevator pitch:

> *Planck units tell you when things become “too small” or “too hot” for ordinary physics.  
> Cliche-Constants adds matching infrared and gravitational scales, telling you when things become “too large, too late, or too hot” for detailed stories.*

## 2. Example snippets for websites or slides

**One-sentence description**

> Cliche-Constants is a tiny open-source project that names and computes extreme “too small / too large / too hot / too late” scales implied by our accelerating universe.

**Two-line description**

> We already use Planck units to mark the smallest and hottest meaningful distances, times, and temperatures.  
> Cliche-Constants adds matching infrared and collapse scales, tied to the Hubble radius, de Sitter entropy, and black-hole formation, with lightweight code in several languages.

## 3. Branding notes

- Keep the visual identity simple:
  - Black-and-white diagrams, logarithmic axes, minimal color.
- Emphasize:
  - “Small, focused, honest.”
  - “Fun names, serious about units.”
