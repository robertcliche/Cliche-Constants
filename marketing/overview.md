# Cliche Constants – Concept Overview

**Tagline:**  
> "If Planck units tell us how small reality can get, Cliche Constants ask how big and how long it can stay meaningful."

The **Cliche Consta
nts** give names to two "edge of meaning" scales in our universe:

- **Cliche Length ℓ^R** – an IR analog of the Planck length, built from the speed of light and the Hubble constant, representing a maximum scale of coherent space.  
- **Cliche Time τ^R** – a tongue-in-cheek "last meaningful moment" based on de Sitter entropy and recurrence ideas, representing a maximum timescale for a unique cosmic history.

They are:

- **Serious enough** to plug into real cosmology and quantum gravity conversations.  
- **Playful enough** to use in talks, blog posts, and thought experiments without pretending to be a new fundamental theory.

Use cases:

- Slides and lectures on **scales in physics** (from Planck to Cliche).  
- Concept art and infographics about the **limits of time and space**.  
- Thought experiments in **philosophy of physics** ("Would you bet on anything at times > τ^R?").  
- Toy models in **tensor networks, cosmological simulations, and emergent spacetime**.
