# One-Pager for Curious Non-Physicists

## Big question

We often hear that:

- There is a **smallest** meaningful size in physics (the *Planck length*), and  
- There is a **shortest** meaningful time (the *Planck time*).

Those ideas come from trying to combine quantum mechanics, gravity, and relativity.

**But what about the other side?**

- Is there a **largest** size that still makes sense as "one connected place"?  
- Is there a **longest** time after which it stops making sense to talk about a single, predictable universe?

That is where the **Cliche Constants** come in.

## Two new names

1. **Cliche Length** – *how big can "here" be?*

   Imagine zooming out until you see the whole observable universe.  
   There is a natural size beyond which parts of the universe cannot affect each other anymore.  
   That size is what the Cliche Length is meant to represent.

2. **Cliche Time** – *how long can "now" stay meaningful?*

   If the universe has only a finite amount of information it can hold, then, in some very deep sense, its patterns might eventually start to repeat (or at least become impossible to distinguish).  
   The Cliche Time is a playful way to talk about a time so huge that **any story about "what happens after that" becomes suspect.**

## Why the name "Cliche"?

Because by the time you reach those scales:

- Every possible cosmic drama has had a chance to play out,  
- Every "original" story might have appeared countless times,  
- Talking about "what happens next" starts to feel like a cosmic cliche.

It is a reminder that our everyday idea of **time as a simple line of events** may have limits.

## What this is for

- Helping people visualize the **range** between:
  - unimaginably small (Planck scale), and  
  - unimaginably large (Cliche scale).  
- Giving science communicators a set of names and symbols they can put on slides, infographics, or videos.  
- Inspiring questions like:
  - "What does 'before' or 'after' even mean near these extremes?"  
  - "Could a universe run out of new stories?"

You do not need to understand the equations to appreciate the basic message:

> Our universe may have not only a smallest pixel size, but also a largest "screen size" and a longest "runtime" for coherent stories.
